# Dashboard Clone (React + Vite)

This folder contains a small React+Vite scaffold that reproduces the UI from `https://react-components-project-seven.vercel.app/`.

How to run locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd c:\Users\HP\Desktop\nexus-practice-app\nexus-practice-app\clone-react
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

Notes:
- Uses Vite + React 18.
- Images are referenced from the original site; copy them to `public/` if you want an offline build.
- If you'd rather I scaffold with TypeScript, Tailwind, or produce a full component library, tell me and I'll update.
